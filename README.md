## Overview of the project
This project is created to explore various bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. It is assumed that this bacteria exists in the human body (belly button), To verify that, weâ€™ve sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that exist in the human belly buttons. This dashboard facilitates the findings and provides an interactive functionality for researchers to explore the various types of bacteria that exist in the belly buttons. The identity of individuals is anonymous.
